# The html and css files located in the develop folder fix semantic issues and organizational problems within the original code. 

# I fixed the repository problems, however when I check the website in VS code it looks perfect, but in the deployed page the CSS layouts I used wont load for some reason! I cant figure out what exactly is causing that issue when the page is live, but when I view in browser from VS code it's flawless. Maybe I could get some help?

# Also, I just saw that I originally got a zero for the assignment due to not having the repository fixed! If there is any way to get this re graded that would be awesome! Thank you!
